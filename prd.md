# Product Requirements Document: Python-CPP Vector Graphics Library

## Executive Summary

A high-performance 2D vector graphics data model library with Python API and future C++ optimization path. The library provides a comprehensive, type-safe approach to creating and manipulating vector graphics with eventual support for millions of objects through C++ integration.

## Vision

Create a production-ready vector graphics library that balances developer experience with performance, starting with a pure Python implementation and evolving to support high-performance scenarios through optional C++ acceleration.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Model Architecture
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Drawing → Layers → Objects → Primitives
- **Type Safety**: Full runtime validation using modern Python type hints
- **Immutability**: All objects immutable by default for predictable state management
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new drawable object types

### 2. Supported Graphics Primitives
- **Basic Shapes**: Circle, Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Polygon, Polyline
- **Advanced Objects**: Arc, Path (SVG-compatible), Text with styling
- **Containers**: Groups for hierarchical organization
- **Transformations**: Translate, rotate, scale, skew support

### 3. Styling System
- **Colors**: RGB/RGBA with named color support
- **Gradients**: Linear and radial gradients
- **Patterns**: Repeatable fill patterns
- **Line Styles**: Width, dash patterns, cap/join styles
- **Text**: Fonts, alignment, baseline control

### 4. Rendering Pipeline
- **SVG Export**: Primary output format with full feature support
- **Visitor Pattern**: Extensible rendering architecture
- **Bounding Box**: Automatic calculation for all objects
- **Layering**: Z-index based rendering order

### 5. Performance Targets
- **Phase 1 (Python)**: Support thousands of objects efficiently
- **Phase 2 (C++ Optional)**: Support millions of objects
- **Memory**: <1KB per object (Python), <50 bytes per object (C++)
- **Rendering**: Linear time complexity with minimal overhead

### 6. Developer Experience
- **Pure Python API**: No compilation required for basic usage
- **Type Hints**: Full typing for IDE support
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with clear errors
- **Documentation**: Examples for all major use cases

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Models Module**
   - Pydantic-based data models
   - Base classes for common functionality
   - Factory methods for object creation

2. **Rendering Module**
   - Pluggable renderer architecture
   - SVG renderer as reference implementation
   - Support for custom renderers

3. **Serialization**
   - JSON import/export
   - Preserves all object properties
   - Backward compatibility considerations

4. **Performance Optimization Path**
   - Keep Python API stable
   - C++ core as drop-in replacement
   - Same validation and behavior

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Pure Python Implementation
- Complete data model with Pydantic v2
- SVG rendering support
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance benchmarking framework

### Phase 2: Production Hardening
- API stabilization
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- Real-world usage examples

### Phase 3: C++ Acceleration (Future)
- C++ core implementation
- Python bindings (pybind11 or similar)
- Transparent API compatibility
- Significant performance gains

## Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Unit tests for all models and methods
- Integration tests for rendering pipeline
- Performance regression tests
- Property-based testing for edge cases

### Code Quality
- Modern Python (3.9+) with type hints
- Linting with ruff
- Formatting with black
- Type checking with mypy

### Documentation
- API reference for all public interfaces
- Architectural decision records
- Performance characteristics
- Migration guides for future versions

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: Support all common 2D vector graphics operations
2. **Performance**: Handle 10,000+ objects in pure Python smoothly
3. **Developer Experience**: <5 minutes to first rendered graphic
4. **Extensibility**: Add new object types without breaking changes
5. **Future-Proof**: Clear path to C++ optimization when needed

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility within major versions
- Python API must remain stable across optimization phases
- No external C++ dependencies in Phase 1
- All features must have Python-only implementation
- Dont Handle any c++ releated activties in phase1

## Future Considerations
* We want to have C++ pybinding which will be copitable with the python model
