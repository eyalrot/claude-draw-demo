  - Font property handling
  - Text alignment algorithms
  - Multi-line text layout
  - Bounding box approximation
  - Text decoration support
  - Text-on-path implementation
  - Special character handling
- **Complexity Reasoning**: Text rendering is inherently complex, involving font metrics, layout algorithms, alignment calculations, and the advanced feature of text-on-path. Without a full font rendering engine, even approximating bounding boxes requires careful implementation.

### Task 8: Create Container Objects

- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity Score**: 7/10

  - Transform attribute generation
  - ViewBox calculations
  - XML formatting
  - SVG spec validation
- **Complexity Reasoning**: SVG rendering requires detailed knowledge of the SVG specification, proper XML generation, unique ID management for definitions, and correct mapping of all style properties. Each shape type needs specific SVG element generation logic.

### Task 11: Add Serialization Support

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Complexity Score**: 6/10
- **Dependencies**: Task 8
- **Recommended Subtasks**: 8

Implement the basic and complex shape primitives along with the container system. This provides the core functionality of the library.

### Phase 3: Rendering Pipeline (Tasks 9-10)

Build the visitor pattern renderer and SVG output capability. This enables actual visualization of the graphics.

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Tasks 6-7, 11)

Add styling system, text support, and serialization. These features enhance the library's capabilities and usability.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Optimization (Task 12)
