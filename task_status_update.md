## Current Focus
**Task 18: Binary Serialization** is currently in progress (77% complete):
- ‚úÖ Binary format specification designed
- ‚úÖ Zero-copy serialization implemented  
- ‚úÖ Compression support added
- ‚úÖ Streaming API created
- ‚úÖ Format validation implemented
- üîÑ Backward compatibility (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Compatibility tests (pending)
- ‚è≥ Serialization benchmarks (pending)

## Key Achievements
1. **Complete Python Foundation**: Tasks 1-4, 8-9, 11 provide full Python drawing library
2. **C++ Performance Layer**: Tasks 13-17 establish high-performance native backend
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Custom allocators and object pools reduce overhead
4. **Container Optimization**: SoA layout enables SIMD processing

## Upcoming Work
1. Complete binary serialization (Task 18)
2. Implement SIMD optimizations (Task 19)
3. Enhance Python-C++ integration (Task 20)
4. Add spatial indexing (Task 21)
5. Create performance testing suite (Task 22)
