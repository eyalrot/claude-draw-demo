# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Visitor Pattern Renderer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the visitor pattern architecture for extensible rendering
# Details:
Create DrawableVisitor protocol with visit methods for each drawable type. Implement BaseRenderer with common rendering logic and transform stack management. Build RenderContext to track current transformation matrix, clipping, and style state. Support pre/post visit hooks for containers. Handle proper rendering order respecting z-index and layer hierarchy.

# Test Strategy:
Test visitor dispatch to correct methods, transform stack push/pop, rendering order verification, custom visitor implementation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define DrawableVisitor protocol interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the DrawableVisitor protocol with visit methods for each drawable type in the system
### Details:
Define a protocol/interface that declares visit methods for Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Polygon, Path, Group, and any other drawable types. Include proper return types and parameter signatures for each visit method.

## 2. Implement RenderContext with transform stack [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create RenderContext class that manages transformation matrix stack and rendering state
### Details:
Implement a RenderContext that maintains a stack of transformation matrices, current rendering attributes (stroke, fill, opacity), and provides push/pop operations for state management. Include methods for applying transformations and querying current state.

## 3. Create BaseRenderer abstract class [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement BaseRenderer as the foundation for concrete renderer implementations
### Details:
Create an abstract BaseRenderer class that implements DrawableVisitor, manages RenderContext, and provides template methods for pre/post visit hooks. Include abstract methods for primitive rendering operations that concrete renderers must implement.

## 4. Implement visitor methods for primitive shapes [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement visit methods for Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, and Polygon drawable types
### Details:
In BaseRenderer, implement visitRectangle, visitCircle, visitEllipse, and visitPolygon methods. Each method should apply transformations from RenderContext, call appropriate rendering primitives, and handle style attributes.

## 5. Implement visitor methods for complex drawables [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement visit methods for Path and Group drawable types with proper traversal
### Details:
Implement visitPath for path rendering and visitGroup for composite drawables. The visitGroup method must handle pushing/popping transform state and recursively visiting children in the correct order.

## 6. Add pre/post visit hooks system [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement pre-visit and post-visit hook mechanisms in BaseRenderer
### Details:
Add preVisit and postVisit protected methods that are called before and after each drawable is processed. These hooks should allow derived renderers to perform setup/cleanup operations and can be overridden for custom behavior.

## 7. Implement z-index sorting and traversal order [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Add z-index handling and proper traversal order implementation for correct rendering
### Details:
Implement z-index sorting logic in Group traversal, ensuring children are visited in the correct order (lowest z-index first). Add depth-first traversal with proper transform stack management. Handle edge cases like equal z-indices and missing z-index values.

## 8. Create extensibility tests and examples [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7
### Description: Write comprehensive tests and examples demonstrating visitor pattern extensibility
### Details:
Create unit tests for visitor pattern implementation, transform stack operations, and rendering order. Write example custom visitors (e.g., BoundingBoxCalculator, HitTestVisitor) to demonstrate extensibility. Include integration tests with mock renderers.
