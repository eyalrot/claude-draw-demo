# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Examples and Benchmarks
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Build comprehensive examples demonstrating library usage and performance benchmarking suite
# Details:
Create examples: basic shapes gallery, complex illustrations, generative art, data visualization, logo recreation. Build performance benchmarks testing object creation, rendering time, memory usage for 100-10,000 objects. Implement profiling decorators to identify bottlenecks. Create comparison metrics for future C++ version. Document performance characteristics and optimization tips.

# Test Strategy:
Ensure all examples run without errors, benchmark results are reproducible, performance meets targets (<1KB per object, linear rendering time)

## 6. Design performance benchmark suite structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architecture and framework for performance testing
### Details:
Design a modular benchmark suite that can test different aspects: shape creation speed, rendering performance, memory usage, and large dataset handling.

## 7. Implement profiling decorator [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Create a decorator function for automatic performance profiling
### Details:
Build a TypeScript decorator that can be applied to methods to automatically measure execution time, memory usage, and call frequency. Include configurable options for different metrics.

## 8. Build metrics collection system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6, 12.7
### Description: Implement a system to collect and aggregate performance metrics
### Details:
Create classes for collecting metrics from profiled functions, aggregating results, calculating statistics (mean, median, percentiles), and storing results for comparison.

## 9. Create performance optimization guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6, 12.7, 12.8
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation on performance best practices
### Details:
Document performance optimization techniques specific to the drawing library, including batch operations, efficient shape reuse, memory management, and rendering optimization strategies.
