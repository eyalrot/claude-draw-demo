# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Serialization Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement JSON serialization/deserialization for all graphics objects
# Details:
Leverage Pydantic's built-in JSON serialization with custom encoders for complex types. Implement type discriminators for polymorphic deserialization of Drawable objects. Support version field for future compatibility. Handle circular references in groups. Create load_drawing() and save_drawing() convenience functions. Preserve all properties including IDs and metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Test round-trip serialization preserves all data, handle malformed JSON gracefully, verify type discrimination works, test large drawings

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up JSON encoder infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create custom JSON encoder class that handles Vector2D instances and other custom types
### Details:
Implement a custom JSONEncoder subclass that can serialize Vector2D objects by converting them to dictionaries with their x, y coordinates. Set up the base infrastructure for extending to other custom types.

## 2. Implement type discriminator system [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add type field to serialized objects for polymorphic identification
### Details:
Modify model classes to include a '__type__' field during serialization that identifies the class type. This will enable proper deserialization of polymorphic collections like shapes and primitives.

## 3. Build polymorphic deserialization logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Create deserializer that reconstructs correct object types based on discriminators
### Details:
Implement a factory pattern or registry system that maps type discriminators to their corresponding classes. Handle nested polymorphic objects and collections properly.

## 4. Handle circular reference detection and resolution [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement system to detect and properly serialize/deserialize circular references
### Details:
Create reference tracking system using object IDs or paths. On serialization, detect cycles and replace with references. On deserialization, maintain object cache and resolve references in a second pass.

## 5. Add version field support to models [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement versioning system for forward/backward compatibility
### Details:
Add 'version' field to all serialized models. Create version migration logic that can upgrade older saved files to current format. Design system to be extensible for future version changes.

## 6. Create convenience load/save functions [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Implement high-level functions for saving and loading drawings to/from files
### Details:
Create Drawing.save_to_file(filename) and Drawing.load_from_file(filename) methods. Handle file I/O, compression options, and proper error reporting. Support both JSON and potentially compressed formats.

## 7. Implement error handling for malformed data [done]
### Dependencies: 11.6
### Description: Add robust error handling and validation for corrupted or invalid serialized data
### Details:
Create custom exception classes for serialization errors. Validate data structure, types, and relationships during deserialization. Provide meaningful error messages indicating what part of the data is invalid.

## 8. Create comprehensive round-trip tests [done]
### Dependencies: 11.7
### Description: Build test suite verifying perfect serialization/deserialization fidelity
### Details:
Test all model types, complex nested structures, circular references, and edge cases. Verify that serialized then deserialized objects are functionally identical to originals. Include performance benchmarks for large drawings.
