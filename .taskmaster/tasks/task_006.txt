# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Styling System
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive styling with gradients, patterns, and line styles
# Details:
Create LinearGradient with stops (color, offset pairs) and angle/points. Implement RadialGradient with center, radius, focal point. Build Pattern system for repeatable fills. Create StrokeStyle with width, dash array, line cap (butt, round, square), line join (miter, round, bevel). Implement FillStyle supporting solid colors, gradients, patterns. Add opacity support throughout.

# Test Strategy:
Test gradient interpolation, pattern tiling, stroke dash calculations, style inheritance and overrides, invalid style parameters

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Style Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create base interfaces and classes for Style, FillStyle, and StrokeStyle that will serve as foundation for all styling components
### Details:
Define Style interface with common properties (opacity, transform), create abstract FillStyle and StrokeStyle base classes with shared functionality. Include style type enumeration and visitor pattern for style processing.

## 2. Implement LinearGradient with Color Stops [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build LinearGradient class supporting multiple color stops, angle/point-based direction, and gradient space transformations
### Details:
Support both angle-based (degrees) and two-point definitions. Implement color stop interpolation with position validation. Handle gradient bounding box calculations and coordinate system transformations.

## 3. Implement RadialGradient with Focal Points [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create RadialGradient class with center/radius definition and optional focal point offset for non-centered gradients
### Details:
Calculate gradient circles with focal point mathematics. Implement conic gradient fallback when focal point is outside radius. Support spread methods (pad, reflect, repeat).

## 4. Design Pattern System Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Architect pattern system supporting image patterns, custom draw patterns, and tiling strategies
### Details:
Define Pattern interface with source abstraction (image, canvas, custom draw function). Implement pattern transform matrix support and tiling modes (repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat).

## 5. Implement StrokeStyle with Dash Arrays [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build comprehensive StrokeStyle supporting dash patterns, line caps, line joins, and miter limits
### Details:
Implement dash array validation and offset calculations. Support all line cap styles (butt, round, square) and join styles (miter, round, bevel). Calculate proper miter limit transitions.

## 6. Create Style Inheritance Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5
### Description: Implement cascading style inheritance system allowing child elements to inherit parent styles with local overrides
### Details:
Build style resolution chain with property-level inheritance control. Support style composition and merging. Implement efficient style caching to avoid redundant calculations.

## 7. Implement Opacity and Compositing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.6
### Description: Add comprehensive opacity handling including group opacity, individual fill/stroke opacity, and blend modes
### Details:
Handle opacity multiplication through inheritance chain. Implement common blend modes (multiply, screen, overlay). Ensure proper compositing order for nested transparent elements.

## 8. Build Style Serialization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Create serialization/deserialization system for all style types supporting JSON and CSS-like syntax
### Details:
Implement style to JSON converters preserving all properties. Create CSS-like string parser for human-readable style definitions. Support style validation and error reporting.

## 9. Integrate Styles with Rendering Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.7, 6.8
### Description: Connect style system to canvas rendering context, handling all style applications and transformations
### Details:
Create RenderContext style application methods. Implement efficient style state management to minimize context switching. Handle style-specific rendering optimizations.

## 10. Create Comprehensive Visual Test Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.9
### Description: Build extensive visual regression tests covering all style combinations and edge cases
### Details:
Generate test cases for gradient interpolations, pattern tiling, stroke dash variations, opacity compositing. Create visual diff tools for style rendering validation. Include performance benchmarks for complex styles.
