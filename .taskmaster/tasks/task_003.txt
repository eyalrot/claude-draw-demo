# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design Abstract Base Classes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the abstract base classes and interfaces that define the graphics object hierarchy
# Details:
Create Drawable abstract base class with id, transform, and get_bounds() method. Design StyleMixin for objects with fill/stroke properties. Implement Primitive base class extending Drawable for basic shapes. Create Container base class for objects that can contain other drawables (groups, layers). Define protocols/interfaces for visitors (DrawableVisitor) and renderers (Renderer). All classes should be immutable with Pydantic's frozen=True.

# Test Strategy:
Test inheritance hierarchies work correctly, abstract methods raise NotImplementedError, immutability is enforced, type annotations are correct with mypy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and document class hierarchy architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive design documentation for the entire class hierarchy including abstract classes, mixins, protocols, and their relationships
### Details:
Document the purpose and responsibilities of each abstract class (Drawable, StyleMixin, Primitive, Container), protocol definitions (DrawableVisitor, Renderer), and how they interact. Include UML diagrams, design patterns used, and rationale for architectural decisions. This documentation will guide the implementation of all subsequent subtasks.

## 2. Implement DrawableVisitor protocol [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Define the DrawableVisitor protocol that establishes the visitor pattern interface for traversing drawable objects
### Details:
Create the protocol with abstract methods for visiting each type of drawable object. Include type hints using Python's Protocol from typing module. Define the contract that all visitor implementations must follow.

## 3. Implement Renderer protocol [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Define the Renderer protocol that establishes the interface for rendering drawable objects to different output formats
### Details:
Create the protocol with abstract methods for rendering operations. Include methods for different rendering contexts (SVG, Canvas, etc.). Define type signatures and expected behavior for renderer implementations.

## 4. Implement StyleMixin abstract class [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the StyleMixin abstract class that provides style-related functionality to be mixed into drawable classes
### Details:
Implement style properties (fill, stroke, opacity, etc.) with Pydantic fields ensuring immutability. Include validation rules, default values, and methods for style manipulation that return new instances rather than modifying state.

## 5. Implement Drawable abstract base class [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create the main Drawable abstract base class that all drawable objects will inherit from
### Details:
Define abstract methods for accept() visitor pattern, bounds calculation, and transformation. Integrate with Pydantic BaseModel for immutability. Include type annotations and ensure proper integration with DrawableVisitor and Renderer protocols.

## 6. Implement Primitive abstract class [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Create the Primitive abstract class that extends Drawable for basic shape objects
### Details:
Inherit from both Drawable and StyleMixin. Define common properties and methods for primitive shapes. Ensure proper multiple inheritance resolution and maintain immutability through Pydantic configuration.

## 7. Implement Container abstract class [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Create the Container abstract class that extends Drawable for objects that can contain other drawables
### Details:
Define methods for adding, removing, and iterating over child drawables while maintaining immutability. Implement proper bounds calculation that considers all children. Include visitor pattern support for traversing container hierarchies.

## 8. Set up type system and Pydantic configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
### Description: Configure Pydantic models for immutability enforcement and set up comprehensive type hints throughout the hierarchy
### Details:
Configure all Pydantic models with frozen=True for immutability. Set up proper validators, serializers, and type coercion. Create custom types where needed. Ensure all methods have complete type annotations including generics where appropriate.

## 9. Create comprehensive inheritance and immutability tests [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
### Description: Develop extensive test suite to verify proper inheritance, protocol implementation, and immutability enforcement
### Details:
Write tests for each abstract class and protocol. Test multiple inheritance scenarios, visitor pattern implementation, immutability (attempting modifications should raise exceptions), type checking, and proper method resolution order. Include edge cases and integration tests.
