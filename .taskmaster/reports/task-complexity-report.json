		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into separate subtasks for directory structure creation, Python packaging setup, development tool configuration, documentation files, Git setup, and pre-commit hooks. Include tasks for verifying the setup works correctly.",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves multiple distinct components: project structure, packaging configuration, multiple development tools, and automation setup. Each component requires specific configuration and verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Base Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create individual subtasks for each model (Point2D, Color, Transform2D, BoundingBox), their validation logic, helper methods, and comprehensive unit tests. Include subtasks for setting up the base model infrastructure and common validation utilities.",
			"reasoning": "This involves implementing multiple complex models with mathematical operations, custom validators, and helper methods. Transform2D alone requires matrix math implementation, and Color needs multiple format support. Each model needs thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design Abstract Base Classes",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate subtasks for each abstract class (Drawable, StyleMixin, Primitive, Container), protocol definitions (DrawableVisitor, Renderer), immutability enforcement, type system setup, and comprehensive inheritance testing. Include design documentation subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This is architecturally critical and complex, requiring careful design of the entire class hierarchy. It involves abstract classes, mixins, protocols, and ensuring proper immutability with Pydantic. The design decisions here affect the entire library."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Shape Primitives",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for each shape implementation (Circle, Rectangle, Ellipse, Line), their bounding box calculations, transformation support, factory methods, and unit tests for each shape. Include a subtask for common shape utilities.",
			"reasoning": "While the shapes themselves are conceptually simple, each requires proper implementation of bounding box calculation, transformation support, and validation. The task is straightforward but involves multiple similar implementations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Complex Shape Primitives",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Polygon/Polyline implementation, Arc mathematics and rendering, SVG path parser implementation with each command type (M, L, C, S, Q, T, A, Z), path validation and simplification, bounding box calculations for curves, and comprehensive testing of each component.",
			"reasoning": "This is highly complex due to SVG path parsing requiring a mini-parser implementation, complex mathematical calculations for curves and arcs, and challenging bounding box calculations for curved segments. The Path implementation alone could be broken into multiple subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Styling System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for LinearGradient implementation, RadialGradient with focal points, Pattern system architecture, StrokeStyle with dash arrays and line joins, FillStyle abstraction, opacity handling, style inheritance mechanism, and comprehensive visual testing.",
			"reasoning": "The styling system involves multiple complex components with mathematical calculations for gradients, pattern tiling logic, and stroke dash computations. Each style type has unique complexities and needs proper abstraction for reusability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Text Support",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into subtasks for basic Text model, font property handling, text alignment algorithms, multi-line text layout, bounding box approximation using font metrics, text decoration support, text-on-path implementation, and special character handling. Include font validation and testing.",
			"reasoning": "Text rendering is inherently complex, involving font metrics, layout algorithms, alignment calculations, and the advanced feature of text-on-path. Without a full font rendering engine, even approximating bounding boxes requires careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Container Objects",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into Group container implementation, Layer system with blend modes, Drawing root container, transform composition for nested containers, z-index ordering implementation, child object management API, bounding box aggregation, and performance optimization for deep hierarchies.",
			"reasoning": "Container objects require careful handling of nested transformations, efficient child management, and proper rendering order. The complexity comes from managing hierarchical relationships and ensuring correct transformation and rendering behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Visitor Pattern Renderer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for DrawableVisitor protocol definition, BaseRenderer implementation, RenderContext with transform stack, visitor method implementations for each drawable type, pre/post visit hooks, z-index handling, proper traversal order implementation, and extensibility testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a proper visitor pattern with transform stack management and correct rendering order is architecturally complex. It requires careful design to ensure extensibility while maintaining performance and correctness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SVG Renderer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into SVG document structure generation, element mapping for each primitive type, style-to-SVG attribute conversion, gradient/pattern definition management with ID generation, transform attribute generation, viewBox calculations, XML formatting, and validation testing against SVG spec.",
			"reasoning": "SVG rendering requires detailed knowledge of the SVG specification, proper XML generation, unique ID management for definitions, and correct mapping of all style properties. Each shape type needs specific SVG element generation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Add Serialization Support",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for JSON encoder setup, type discriminator implementation, polymorphic deserialization, circular reference handling, version field support, convenience load/save functions, error handling for malformed data, and round-trip testing.",
			"reasoning": "While Pydantic provides base serialization, implementing proper polymorphic deserialization with type discriminators and handling circular references adds complexity. The versioning system also requires forward-thinking design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Create Examples and Benchmarks",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into basic shapes example, complex illustration example, generative art demo, data visualization example, logo recreation demo, performance benchmark suite implementation, profiling decorator creation, metrics collection and reporting, performance optimization guide, and example documentation.",
			"reasoning": "While not technically complex, this task involves creating diverse examples and a comprehensive benchmarking system. Each example serves a different purpose and the benchmarking suite needs careful design to provide meaningful metrics."
