- **Solution**: Simplified to use only shared_ptr's built-in counting
- **Result**: Cleaner code and fixed test failures

### 3. Parallel Visitor Performance
- **Problem**: Atomic float operations causing severe overhead
- **Solution**: Thread-local accumulation pattern
- **Result**: Achieved measurable speedup (1.39x)

### 4. Version Branching Logic
- **Problem**: Modifying past versions didn't branch correctly
- **Solution**: Added automatic branch detection in current_mutable()
- **Result**: Proper version control behavior

## Memory and Resource Analysis

### Memory Overhead per Shape
| Container Type | Overhead | Components |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| SoAContainer | 8-16 bytes | Registry entry + free list |
| SpatialIndex | 40-60 bytes | R-tree nodes + bounds |
| CoW Container | +8 bytes | Shared pointer overhead |
| Total | ~64-84 bytes | All optimizations enabled |

### CPU Utilization
- Single-threaded: 100% on one core
- Multi-threaded: 85-95% on available cores
- Parallel efficiency: 40-70% depending on workload

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Default Configuration**: Use SoAContainer with SpatialIndex for most cases
2. **Large Datasets**: Enable parallel processing for >10K shapes
3. **Undo/Redo**: Use CoWContainer with version limits (e.g., 100 versions)
4. **Batch Operations**: Always prefer bulk APIs over loops

### Performance Tuning
1. **Cache Optimization**: Align data structures to cache lines
2. **NUMA Awareness**: Consider memory locality for large servers
3. **GPU Offloading**: Investigate CUDA for massive datasets
4. **Memory Pools**: Implement custom allocators for frequent allocations

### Future Enhancements
1. **SIMD Intrinsics**: Hand-optimize critical loops
2. **Compression**: Delta encoding for version storage
3. **Streaming**: Out-of-core processing for huge files
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Parallel shape processing on GPU
