## ðŸš€ Ready for Development

The infrastructure is now fully set up and ready for implementing:
- High-performance core data models (Point2D, Color, Transform2D, BoundingBox)
- Optimized shape primitives
- Container optimizations
- SIMD-accelerated operations
- Memory pooling and batch operations

## ðŸ“Š Performance Baseline

Initial benchmarks show:
- Aligned memory allocation: ~20-60ns
- Memory copy bandwidth: 15-90 GB/s
- SIMD detection overhead: ~3-4ns
- Float array operations: Ready for SIMD optimization

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. Implement Task 14: Native Core Data Models
2. Create SIMD-optimized operations
3. Build Python integration layer
4. Benchmark against pure Python implementation
