# Container Benchmark Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the performance characteristics of the optimized container implementations in the Claude Draw C++ library.

## Test Environment
- CPU: 16-core processor with AVX512 support
- Compiler: GCC with -O3 optimization
- Test Date: 2025-07-25

## Benchmark Results

### 1. SoA Container Operations

#### Insertion Performance
- **Single Type (Circle)**: 4.8-6.4M shapes/second
- **Mixed Types**: 3.3-6.3M shapes/second
- Performance remains consistent across different container sizes

#### Removal Performance
- **Small containers (100 shapes)**: ~836K removals/second
- **Large containers (10K shapes)**: ~12K removals/second
- **Issue identified**: Removal performance degrades significantly with container size

#### Bounds Calculation
- **All sizes**: 55-76M operations/second
- Incremental bounds tracking provides O(1) performance

### 2. Spatial Index (R-tree)

#### Insertion
- **100 shapes**: 2.34M insertions/second
- **10K shapes**: 1.26M insertions/second
- Performance scales well with tree size

#### Query Performance
- **Small trees (100 shapes)**: 3.87M queries/second
- **Large trees (10K shapes)**: 36K queries/second
- Query performance depends on result set size

### 3. Parallel Processing

#### Parallel Visitor
- **1K shapes**: 970K shapes/second
- **100K shapes**: 118M shapes/second
- Excellent scaling with larger datasets due to better thread utilization

### 4. Copy-on-Write Containers

#### Copy Performance
- **All sizes**: 18-31M copies/second
- O(1) copy operation due to reference counting

#### Write Trigger (First Modification)
- **100 shapes**: 35K operations/second
- **10K shapes**: 349 operations/second
- Cost of deep copy on first write

### 5. Bulk Operations

#### Bulk Insert
- **Performance**: 5.7-6.3M shapes/second
- Similar to individual insertion, showing efficient pre-allocation

#### Bulk Transform
- **Performance**: ~350M shapes/second
- Extremely fast due to linear memory access pattern

### 6. Complete Workflow
- **Combined operations**: 0.83-1.39M shapes/second
- Includes insertion, spatial indexing, querying, and bounds calculation

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Excellent insertion performance** with consistent throughput
2. **O(1) bounds calculation** through incremental tracking
3. **Efficient bulk operations** with pre-allocation
4. **Scalable parallel processing** for large datasets
5. **Zero-cost CoW copies** until modification

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Container removal performance** - Currently O(n) due to entry lookup
2. **R-tree bulk loading** - STR algorithm not yet implemented
3. **Memory fragmentation** after many removals (needs compaction)

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize removal**: Implement reverse index mapping for O(1) removal
2. **Implement STR bulk loading**: For faster R-tree construction
3. **Auto-compaction**: Trigger compaction after threshold of removals
4. **SIMD optimization**: Apply to more container operations
5. **Thread pool reuse**: Share thread pool across parallel operations

## Conclusion

The container implementations demonstrate strong performance characteristics suitable for high-performance graphics applications. The SoA layout provides excellent cache efficiency, while features like incremental bounds tracking and CoW semantics enable efficient operations at scale. The identified bottlenecks in removal operations should be addressed in future optimizations.
